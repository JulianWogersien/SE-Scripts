# MDK Analyzers

---

The game [Space Engineers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/244850/Space_Engineers/)
(by [Keen Software House](https://www.keenswh.com/), no affiliation) supports
scripting and modding using the C# language, but limited by a built-in whitelist to
protect against dangerous or destructive code. This analyzer aims to inform the
developer when they're trying to use parts of the .NET framework or game API they are
not allowed to use.

_This package is part of the MDK2 project._

### Usage:

Simply reference the nuget package in your mod project. It should automatically start
analyzing your project.

Nuget unfortunately does not notify you when there's updates to nuget packages, so
you should check manually now and again, especially after game updates.

### Ignoring paths and folders

Edit your project file. Within the first <PropertyGroup>, add

```xml
<Mdk-IgnorePaths>$(Mdk-IgnorePaths)|PathToIgnore\**\*</Mdk-IgnorePaths>
```

Everything in that path, recursively, will now be ignored by the analyzer.
Add multiple patterns with `|`:

```xml
<Mdk-IgnorePaths>$(Mdk-IgnorePaths)|FirstPath\**\*|**\*.debug.cs</Mdk-IgnorePaths>
```

Including the $(Mdk-IgnorePaths) will _add_ to the ignore list rather than replace it.
