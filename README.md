# SE-Scripts

This repository contains ingame scripts for space engineers i wrote.  
This Document lists all of them and their purpose.  

## Scripts

1. SEIceChecker  
This Script Checks how much ice is left in the base (it ignores subgrids i.e. attached ships)  
and if it falls below some threshold (default 10k) it will warn you by blinking the lights and  
changing their color to red.
2. SEMiner  
This script is unfinished and only partially works.  
It is supposed to control a quarry (rotor is spinnign a down and sidewards piston which mines out a large area)  
however i dont need this anymore and i probably wont finish it any time soon.
